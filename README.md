## Reflection
1. This project does not include responsive design, but if I were to this project again I would change the CSS or HTMLto display the image on the left.
2. On the form, I decided to layout the form in first columns, if I were to do this again I would change the column design as the tab goes from top to bottom instead of left to right. However, in the end I would use grid instead of flexbox.
3. Initially, I would not highlight incorrect forms before input has been added, but I've done so in this project to match The Odin Project screenshot example.
